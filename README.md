This repository showcases the foundational HTML skills I've recently learned as part of my journey to becoming a better web developer. It demostrates my understanding of essential HTML concepts such as links, attributes, page structure, and general best practices.

The project features a collection of simple recipe pages, with a focus on creating the perfect cup of coffee. Each page is designed to reinfore and demonstrate practical HTML usage in a real-world context.
